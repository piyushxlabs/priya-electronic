# Energy-Saving Tips for Home Appliances: Reduce Your Electricity Bill

Electricity bills in Raiwala and Dehradun can skyrocket during summer months. The good news? Your home appliances can run more efficiently with simple changes.

At **Priya Electronic**, we don't just sell appliances—we help families in Raiwala use them smartly. Here are proven tips to reduce your electricity consumption.

## General Energy-Saving Principles

Before specific tips, understand these rules:

1. **Star ratings matter:** 5-star appliances use 30-50% less electricity
2. **Maintenance is key:** Dirty appliances work harder = more electricity
3. **Right usage habits:** How you use matters as much as what you buy
4. **Upgrade old appliances:** 10+ year old machines are energy vampires

## Air Conditioner Energy-Saving Tips

### 1. Set Optimal Temperature

**Don't:** Set AC to 16-18°C  
**Do:** Set to 24-25°C

**Science:** Each degree below 24°C increases electricity by 6%!

**Raiwala Reality Check:**  
24°C with fan feels as comfortable as 20°C without fan—but uses 20-25% less electricity.

**Annual Savings:** ₹3,000-5,000 for average Dehradun family

---

### 2. Use Timers & Sleep Mode

- **Auto shut-off after 2-3 hours** (body adjusts to temperature)
- **Sleep mode** gradually increases temperature—saves 25-30% electricity
- Morning hours (4-7 AM) are coolest—AC not needed

**Priya Electronic Tip:** All modern ACs have these features—use them!

---

### 3. Maintenance Matters

**Clean filters every 2 weeks:**
- Dirty filters block airflow
- AC works 20-30% harder
- Increases electricity consumption

**Annual service (before summer):**
- Gas pressure check
- Coil cleaning
- Thermostat calibration

**Cost:** ₹500-800 service vs ₹2,000+ extra electricity bills

---

### 4. Room Preparation

**Close doors/windows** when AC running (seems obvious but many don't!)

**Use curtains/blinds:**
- Blocks direct sunlight
- Reduces AC load by 30-40%
- Especially important for west-facing rooms in Raiwala

**Ceiling fan combo:**
- Run AC at 25°C + ceiling fan
- Feels like 22°C
- Saves 20% electricity

---

## Refrigerator Energy-Saving Tips

### 1. Optimal Temperature Settings

**Fridge compartment:** 2-3°C  
**Freezer:** -18°C

**Don't go colder:** Each degree colder = 5% more electricity

### 2. Door Management

**Minimize door opening:**
- Decide what you need BEFORE opening
- Don't keep door open while thinking
- Each opening loses 5-7% cold air

**Check door seal:**
- Put paper between door and fridge
- Close door
- Paper should not slip out
- If it does, seal is weak—get it replaced

### 3. Proper Food Storage

**Don't overload:**
- Blocks air circulation
- Compressor works harder

**Don't keep too empty either:**
- Food items help maintain temperature
- 60-70% full is optimal

**Cool food before storing:**
- Hot food makes fridge work extra hard
- Especially important in Dehradun summers

### 4. Defrost Regularly (if not frost-free)

**Ice buildup = insulation layer:**
- Reduces cooling efficiency
- Can increase electricity by 30%

**Defrost when ice is 5-6mm thick**

### 5. Location Matters

**Away from heat sources:**
- Not near gas stove, oven, sunlight
- Each 1°C ambient temperature increase = 2-4% more electricity

**Adequate ventilation:**
- 3-4 inches gap from wall
- Don't block coils at back

## Washing Machine Energy-Saving Tips

### 1. Wash with Full Loads

**Half load ≠ half electricity:**
- Actually uses 60-70% electricity of full load
- Wait for full load accumulation

**For Raiwala families:**
- Wash 2-3 times per week with full loads
- Better than daily small loads

### 2. Use Cold Water When Possible

**Hot water washing:**
- Uses 80-90% more electricity
- Heater element is biggest power consumer

**Cold water is fine for:**
- Regular dirty clothes
- Light stains
- Most Indian fabrics

**Use hot only for:**
- Heavy stains
- Sanitization needs
- Specific fabric care

### 3. Choose Right Wash Cycle

**Quick wash (15-30 min):**
- Lightly soiled clothes
- Uses 50% less energy

**Normal wash (45-60 min):**
- Regular soiling

**Heavy wash (90+ min):**
- Only when really needed

### 4. Spin Speed Optimization

**Higher RPM in spin cycle:**
- Removes more water
- Clothes dry faster
- Less energy needed for drying

**But for delicates:** Use lower RPM to prevent damage

### 5. Load Balancing

**Unbalanced load:**
- Machine vibrates excessively
- Works harder
- Wastes energy

**Proper loading:**
- Mix large and small items
- Distribute evenly
- Don't wrap clothes around agitator

## Television Energy-Saving Tips

### 1. Brightness Settings

**Factory settings = too bright:**
- Reduce brightness by 30-40%
- Still looks great
- Saves 20-30% electricity

### 2. Power Management

**Standby mode uses electricity:**
- Switch off from main when not in use
- Or use power strip with switch

### 3. Screen Size Consideration

**Bigger ≠ always better:**
- 43" TV in 12x10 room is enough
- 55" uses 40% more electricity
- For small rooms, right-sizing saves money

---

## Bonus: Smart Usage Habits

### 1. Off-Peak Hour Usage

In areas with time-of-day pricing, use heavy appliances during off-peak hours.

### 2. Unplug When Not Used

**Ghost load (standby power):**
- Appliances use 5-10% electricity even when "off"
- Unplug TV, washing machine when not in use

### 3. Regular Maintenance Schedule

**Create calendar reminders:**
- AC filter cleaning: Every 2 weeks
- Refrigerator coil cleaning: Every 6 months
- Washing machine drum cleaning: Every month

---

## When to Upgrade for Savings

**Old appliance (10+ years) consuming too much?**

**Calculate ROI:**
- Old fridge: ₹1,000/month electricity
- New 5-star: ₹500/month
- **Savings: ₹500/month = ₹6,000/year**
- New fridge costs ₹25,000
- **Pays for itself in 4 years + runs for 10+ years!**
